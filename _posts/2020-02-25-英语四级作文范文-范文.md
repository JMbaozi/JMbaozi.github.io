Certificate Craze on Campus



In recent years, to get a certificate has become anew craze among college students. Just randomly ask a student on campus what he or she isbusy doing, quite possibly, you may get the answer that he is preparing for a certificate ofsome kind. Why does this craze appear?



There are mainly two reasons behind this phenomenon. To begin with, it is theemployment pressure that forces college students to get more certificates. With the admissionexpansion of colleges, a lot more graduates have to face the fierce competition in the jobmarket. How can one make himself more competitive? More certificates at hand, maybe.Furthermore, diploma and certificates are still vital standards by which a good many employersmeasure a person’s ability. In order to increase the qualifications for a job, the studentscompel themselves to run from one exam to another.



From my point of view, we should be more rational when it comes to certificates, sincecertificates do not necessarily prove one’s ability. Being crazy in getting certificates blindly isnothing but wasting time. To conclude, we should focus on improving our ability but notgetting a certificate of no practical value.

英语四级图表作文范文：电影电视的影响

How do movies or television influence people’sbehavior? Use reasons and specific examples tosupport your answer.

【范文】

The Influence of Television and Movies

There is no doubt that watching television andmovies can influence the way that people behave.Moreover, it seems that people are spending moreand more time watching some sort of visualentertainment, whether it is television, a video tapeor a DVD. Therefore, the effects of visual media cannot be ignored.

One obvious effect of these media is that watching them induces people to buy certainproducts. Television advertising is widespread and, nowadays, even movie theaters permitadvertisements. Another way TV and the movies affect people is that they give people either abroader view of the world or a distorted one, depending on what type of program they watch.Those who watch news and educational program can learn many new things while those whowatch primarily entertainment shows may come to believe that most people in the worldpossess great wealth and good looks. It may make them become dissatisfied with their ownlives. Finally, perhaps the most susceptible viewers are children, who may be unable to tell factfrom fiction and may try to imitate acts that they see on TV or in the movies.

With the ever-increasing popularity of video entertainment, society must pay attention tothese effects. Television and movies, while entertaining and informative, cannot take the placeof real experience.

Advantages and Disadvantages of the MobilePhone

With the rapid economic development, the mobilephone has found its way into campuses and a hostof students take advantage of this wonderfulgadget to communicate with each other. Thisphenomenon gives rise to this question: What arethe advantages and disadvantages of the mobilephone?

It is widely believed that it greatly facilitatesstudents’ campus life. Many instances could be foundto support this type of opinion. A graduating student in our university bought a mobile phonein the course of hunting for his job. He told me that through the mobile phone he could easilykeep in touch with the employer of the company he intends to work with and would not missany opportunities.

However, everything has both positive and negative facets. The mobile phone also hasmany disadvantages. For instance, the ringing of the mobile phone often disturbs the teacher’steaching and other students’ learning.

Personally, the advantages of the mobile phone outweigh the disadvantages of it as long aswe don’t interfere with others while using it.

Extravagant Spending on College Campus

According to a survey, in recent years the monthly expenditure of a college student hasbeen on the sharp rise. Many college students have no concept of thrift in their mind. Theytake it for granted that they spend money from their parents before they enter into the society.This extravagant spending is primarily caused by the following factors.

First of all, nowadays most of the students are the only children of their families. They arethe apple in their family’s eyes and naturally get more care and pocket money. In addition, withthe improvement of living standards, parents can afford higher expenditure of their children.Moreover, some students like to pursue fashion and trends, which tend to need more money.Finally, campus love is also a possible factor causing extravagant spending.

From my point of view, a college student, as a pure consumer, should learn to be thrifty.We should limit our expenditure on daily necessities but not buy whatever we want regardlessof their prices. The habit of thrift can help us form right values and is favorable to our futuredevelopment.

Frustration Education should beStrengthened among College Students

It is universally acknowledged that college students should be guided correctly to facefrustrations in life. Frustration is inevitable during our life, and frustration education should becarried out among colleges and universities. The truth of it is deep and profound.

A great many remarkable illustrations contribute to this argument. A case in point is thatthere are an increasing number of college students committing suicide each year whenconfronted with some kind of frustration. This is close to suggest that strengtheningfrustration education allows of no delay. As a matter of fact, it seems that successful peopletend to be good at dealing with frustrations. Moreover, most of the students are oftenannoyed and discouraged by frustrations instead of drawing lessons.

Judging from the evidence offered, we might safely draw the conclusion that frustrationeducation is essential to the college students.

And among them, the high-educated, like masters and doctors, take quite a largepercentage. The craze in civil servant test has attracted widespread attention.

The following fundamental causes can account for this kind of craze. First and foremost,nowadays college students face great employment pressure. Civil servant, as one of the moststable professions in today’s China, becomes their preferable choice. Moreover, recently, thewelfare and salary of civil servants have been improved greatly, which undoubtedly attractsmany people. Last but not least, the high social position of civil servants is a crucial factordrawing many people to take part in the civil servant test.

In my opinion, this craze in civil servant test will continue in the following years. However,from the long run, it does not do good to the development of our nation. If most high qualitytalents gather in the government departments, it might lead to a waste of resources.Accordingly, both the individuals and the government should have a more objectiverecognition of the civil servant test craze.

【范文】

Nowadays, going abroad for studies is enjoying astriking popularity among adolescents. Importanceshould be attached to studying abroad.

There are a great many advantages of studying overseas. First and foremost, living andstudying abroad offers students a different perspective of the world. On a university campus,international students are likely to encounter their counterparts from various countries andareas and are exposed to diverse ideas and values. What is more, overseas experience is thebest opportunity for the real-life use of foreign languages. There is no better opportunity toimprove second-language skills than living in the country in which it is spoken.

Generally peaking, it is my view that although going abroad is expensive and perhapspainful, the payoff is worthwhile. In the first place, in addition to knowledge, overseasstudents can gain precious experiences that those who stay at home will never have.Furthermore, overseas experience, frustrating and painful as it may be, is conducive to thegrowth of adolescents.

大学生难找工作，原因很多，解决的办法。

【范文】

Job hunting has always been a headache forcollege students. Though many graduates areemployed right after graduation, some are not. Mostserious of all, some still have no idea where to go working even a long time after graduation.

The reasons for this phenomenon are various. On the one hand, a few years ago collegesand universities enrolled so many students in popular majors, such as economy, finance andso on that the number of graduates was greater than the need in the market. On the otherhand, most graduates would rather stay in large cities without suitable job to do than go tothe country.

I reckon this problem can be solved if both colleges and students take measures. First, theyshould research the market and develop special skills to suit its need. Second, students’attitude towards employment should be changed. They should go to small cities and country.There they can also give full play to their professional knowledge. In a word, if we pay muchattention, the situation can be improved.

On the one hand, no one denies that Internet is currently one of the most useful media inour daily life. As a college student, I get on line every day to exchange information through e-mails with my net friends. But on the other hand, a good many people admit that they are toomuch addicted to Internet to maintain a regular and wholesome lifestyle.

Thus, it is necessary for us to use Internet in a reasonable way and restrain fromoverindulgence. After all，Internet is invented to enrich our life, and to improve the efficiencyof our work rather than shackle us with a chain.

　Directions:Study the following picture carefullyand write an essay in which you should

　　1) describe the picture,

　　2) interpret itsmeaning, and

　　3) support your view with examples.

【范文】

　　One glance at a pyramid can leave the viewer in awe of its beauty and splend or. Uponcloser examination, however, one might be surprised to discover that such a grandiosestructure is composed entirely of ordinary stones.

　　Most people are familiar with the proverb: Rome was not built in a day. An object as grandas a pyramid is likewise not so quickly or easily constructed. Just as the greatness of the cityof Rome is due to the combination of its smaller parts, a pyramid is only as strong as thestones it is comprised of. The image of a pyramid reminds us that great success is in fact anaccumulation of small a chievements.

　　History proves that many famous artists and scientists are only successful because of theircontinued efforts, even after numerous failures. One might recall Leonardo DaVinci's drawing ofan egg, Wang Xi Zhi practicing handwriting, or Thomas Edison inventing the light bulb, forexample. The fable that tells us that even water can eventually pierce through stone alsopoints to the importance of patience and diligence. We should take such stories and historiesinto account and remember the importance of fundamentals; remember that one can build apyramid only if one is willing to work with small stones. People would be wise to abandonrash inclinations and instead try in earnest. Perseverance is sure to leadto success.
